During my M.A. in Economics at NYU, I mainly focus on undertaking advanced math and economics classes as preparation for a Ph.D. in Economics. I also focused on writing academic papers on applied microeconomics topics. You may find some of them in my [Research](https://nicoidominguez.github.io/research/) section. 

Before going to grad school, I was a consultant at the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Production, where I worked in their Research and Impact Evaluation offices, mainly developing impact evaluation designs for each Ministry's interventions. I also was a research assistant at the Group for the Analysis of Development ([GRADE](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/)), a top think tank in Peru, where I worked with Senior Researcher [Juan-José Díaz](http://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/jjdiaz/) in several of his projects in the fields of gender and labor. I also held the same position supporting [Miguel-Ángel Carpio](https://sites.google.com/view/miguel-angel-carpio), as well his coauthors, in a policital economy project.
