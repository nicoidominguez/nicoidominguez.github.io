<p align="justify"> During my M.A. in Economics at NYU, I mainly focus on undertaking advanced math and economics classes as preparation for a Ph.D. in Economics. I recently did a Graduate Summer Internship at the IDB's Department of Research, working with <a href='https://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/author/eric-parrado-herrera'>Eric Parrado</a> in a labor market project. I am also focusing on writing academic papers on applied microeconomics topics. You may find some of them in my <a href='https://nicoidominguez.github.io/research/'>research</a> section. </p>

<p align="justify"> Before going to grad school, I was a consultant at the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Production, where I worked in their Research and Impact Evaluation offices, mainly developing impact evaluation designs for each Ministry's interventions. I also was a research assistant at the Group for the Analysis of Development (<a href='https://www.grade.org.pe/en/'>GRADE</a>), a top Think-Tank in Latin America, where I worked with Senior Researcher <a href='http://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/jjdiaz/'>Juan-José Díaz</a> in several of his projects in the fields of gender, health and labor economics. I also held the same position supporting <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/miguel-angel-carpio'>Miguel-Ángel Carpio</a> and coauthors in a political economy project. </p>
