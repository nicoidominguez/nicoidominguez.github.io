# About me
Before going to grad school I was a research assistant at the GRADE, where I worked with professor Christopher Neilson in several of his projects. I also held the same position for two years at J-PAL LAC, working with Chris, as well as with professors Dina Pomeranz, Sebasti√°n Bustos and Gabriel Zucman, based in Chile and The Dominican Republic.
