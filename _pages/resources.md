This page is a repository of resources of various types. These include codes I've written performing some cleaning or scrapping processes for social science research purposes (so you don't have to clean them from scratch!), as well as lectures I've prepared for miscellaneous events and lectures (forthcoming!).

## Coding efforts

- PERU. [ENAHO 2004-2020](https://github.com/nicoidominguez/PERU-ENAHO). Household Survey (_Stata_).

- [PERU. SIAF 2007-2013. Scrapping local governments' income from Mining canon](https://github.com/nicoidominguez/PERU-SIAF). (Python).
- [PERU. Google's Geocoding API to retrieve coordinates from addresses](https://github.com/nicoidominguez/PERU-GeocodingAPI). (Python).
- [US. GSS 1973-2021. Household Survey](). (Stata).

## Lectures

Here I'll put the materials from the lecture I've designed to teach Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learing with Python at Universidad de Piura, Peru (_forthcoming 2023-II_).
