abstract: 'What is the impact of improving the transit infrastructure on the gender earnings gap? How does family structure matter to understand the impact of new transit infrastructure? Recent models on spatial economics hinge on the assumption that households are comprised of a single type of person making commuting and location choices. In reality, an important share of the population lives in households with more persons, whose commuting choices might be interlinked through the household&apos;s budget constraint. I set up and estimate a quantitative model of city structure featuring single and married households leveraging on the introduction of a Metro line and the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) in Lima, Peru. My model delivers interdependent commuting choices within dual-earner households. This way, reduced commute times impact one partner&apos;s commuting patterns not only by affecting her prospects, but also those of her spouse. I show that this mechanism is quantitatively important. If I ignore this mechanism, I would overestimate gains in real income by 11 percent and underestimate reductions in the gender earnings gap by 103 percent, leading to a switch in the sign of the impact of the Metro and the BRT.
